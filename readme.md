When you are done with your adroid phone, you may want to sell or gift it.
Before doing so, it is recommended to perform a factory reset to protect your personal data.
After you've done that, install and run Malleus.

CNet has a great article on reducing your exposure to identity theft -
http://www.cnet.com/how-to/the-best-way-to-completely-wipe-your-android-device/

But how many people will actually follow Step three: Load dummy data? 
With Malleus, this is just a button click.

## Project status - beta

The beta version of Malleus keeps it simple, and does 1 thing 

- Overwrite all of your unused diskspace with random data.

About 99% of android users can run Malleus which is designed to work on Android versions Froyo and forward. 


## Disclaimer: 

    Malleus has not been verified by internal or external entities. 
    The code may be still of beta quality and may not fully prevent
    recovery of personal information.
