When you sell your phone, be sure to protect your privacy:

* Run the recommended factory reset.
* Install and run Data Hammer.

Data Hammer is designed to be easy to use. It shreds, or overwrites your unused storage with random data, so it can't be undeleted.


## FAQ

#### Can I only run Data Hammer before disposing of my phone?
No. It is safe to run daily.

#### Can I run other programs while Data Hammer is running?
It's not a good idea. Data Hammer is resource intensive.
Other programs may act flakey or crash, but they will work fine after Data Hammer completes.

#### How long does Data Hammer take to run?
Milage will vary. It takes about 1 minute per gb of free data on my Nexus4.
If your screen is off when DataHammer is finished, it will try to flash an LED.

#### Can I stop and restart Data Hammer?
Yes. You can stop Data Hammer from the task switcher and restart.
When restarted, it will pick up where it left off.

#### What if I don't want to restart Data Hammer?
You'll need to release storage that has been shredded.
In Settings>Apps>DataHammer, click on 'Clear data'.

#### What versions is Data Hammer compattible with?
This program runs on my Nexus4 with KitKat 4.4.4, both Dalvik and ART operating systems.
Emulator tests pass for Froyo thru 'L'
